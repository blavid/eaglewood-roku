# Guest menu

The left rail, the Things to Do list, and the Quick Fixes list all come from one file. The channel packages a copy and replaces it when a newer copy fetches cleanly.

- Packaged file: `channel/data/menu.json`
- Same example: `docs/menu.json`
- Live file: `https://sunrivertownhome.com/data/menu.json`

## Shape

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "items": [
    { "id": "home", "label": "Home", "type": "home" },
    { "id": "wifi", "label": "Wi-Fi", "type": "wifi" },
    {
      "id": "todo",
      "label": "Things to Do",
      "type": "things",
      "children": [
        {
          "id": "dining",
          "label": "Dining",
          "empty": "Nothing to show yet.",
          "sectionIds": ["dining"],
          "keywords": [],
          "seasons": []
        }
      ]
    },
    { "id": "rules", "label": "House Rules", "type": "rules" },
    {
      "id": "fixes",
      "label": "Quick Fixes",
      "type": "quickfixes",
      "source": "guide.troubleshooting"
    },
    { "id": "book", "label": "Book Direct", "type": "book" },
    { "id": "checkout", "label": "Checkout Instructions", "type": "checkout" }
  ]
}
```

`type` is one of `home`, `wifi`, `things`, `rules`, `quickfixes`, `book`, `checkout`. `things` is the only type with `children`. A child `id` is the screen the activity grid opens. `sectionIds`, `keywords`, and `seasons` decide which activities appear. `empty` is the sentence shown when that list has nothing.

`source` on Quick Fixes is `guide.troubleshooting`. The list titles and the scrolling steps are read from `guide.json` troubleshooting. The Wi-Fi how-to stays off that list. Do not paste the steps into `menu.json`.

## Edits

1. Rename a row: change its `label`.
2. Reorder the rail: move objects inside `items`. The first seven top items are the rail.
3. Add a Things to Do row: add a child under `things` with an `id`, `label`, and the mapping fields.
4. Point a child at different activities: edit `sectionIds`, `keywords`, or `seasons`. Leave the activity text in `activities.json`.
5. Keep Quick Fixes on the guide: leave `source` as `guide.troubleshooting`.

A bad `type`, a missing label, or a Things to Do block with no children is ignored. The channel keeps the previous good menu.

## When a change shows up

The channel fetches the live file on launch and again every six hours. A new ETag replaces the saved copy. A failed fetch keeps the saved copy, then the packaged file. Sideload a new package to change the packaged fallback.
